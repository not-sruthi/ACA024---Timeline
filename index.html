        <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>Vincent Zhao (born October 25, 2000, in San Jose, California) began skating in 2005. When he was
            nine, he became a member of the All Year Figure Skating Club, and won three national titles at 
            different levels in three consecutive years. 
        </p>

        <p> Zhou intended to skate at the senior level in the 2013–2014 season, but missed the season due to an 
            injury. He was also forced to sit out the entire 2014–15 season because of other injuries, which
            he had to undergo surgery to fix. In the spring of 2015, Zhou began training at the Broadmoor Skating 
            Club in Colorado Springs.
        </p>

        <h2> Personal Life</h2>

        <p>
            When Zhou was a baby, his family moved to Palo Alto, California, where they continue to 
            reside. Zhou moved with his mother to Colorado Springs, Colorado in the spring of 2015 and 
            returned to California a year later. He has since returned to Colorado Springs, where he 
            spends the majority of his time. He had a Siamese tabby cat named Snookie. He volunteers regularly. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Zhou attended Capistrano Connections Academy, an online school, to accommodate his training. He received 
            the Presidential Award for Educational Excellence,  a recognition awarded at the sole discretion of his 
            school principal. Zhou enrolled at Brown University in the fall of 2019.
